The tkmeans package attempts to implement the trimmed k-means algorithm of Cuesta-Albertos, et al. (1997) using as little memory as possible.
Data is editted in place, the trimming is implemented using a priority queue structure in C++ trhough Rcpp and low memory use versions of utility functions are provided.

An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.

To install the latest version run:

  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  install_github("andrewthomasjones/tkmeans")


An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
